Demonstrator of evolving solver for laplace's equation and comparing with convolutional neural net approach

* Main -- read in data file, land mask, extract Eurasia and mark land pts
* Delta-finder -- evaluate laplacean on grid
* SOR -- successive overrelaxation 
      -- (k, w) where k = range in second derivative, w = sor weight
      -- (k, w) as above, but with depending on location
* Scorer -- evaluate max abs err, rmse <-- part of laplacean computation

Define 'truth' as result of k = 1, w = 1 to tolerance 1.e-6(?) max, rms
